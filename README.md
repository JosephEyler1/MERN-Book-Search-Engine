# MERN Book Search Engine

## Overview
This is my MERN Book Search Engine project which allows users to do find books that they want to read and add them to a list! Here is what this application allows you to do:

```md
1. Creating a user and logging into the application with said user.
2. Search for any book via the search bar.
3. Add or delete books to your list of books you'd like to read, which can be looked at by clicking on the corresponding button.
```

AS A programmer
I WANT to make an application that allows for easy use of the GraphQL API
SO THAT I can show employers my skills with converting the program from the Restful API to the GraphQL API, as well as experience with MERN, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js.
```
